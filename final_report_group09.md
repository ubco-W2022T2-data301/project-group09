# Final Report (Group 09)

## Introduction 
Our Group Project aims to explore the issue of Gun Deaths in America , which has become a significant concern in the United States in the recent years. We will be focusing on specific aspects of gun violence, including the age of the victim, intent, race, place of incident and education level of the victim involved in the incident. By analyzing these variables, we hope to identify trends and patterns that may reveal insights into the demographics circumstances surrounding gun violence in America. To conduct our analysis, we have used a dataset sourced from the FiveThirtyEight's Gun Deaths in America Project, which contains detailed records of around 100,000 gun-related incidents that occurred in the US between 2012 and 2014. Our ultimate goal is to contribute a better understanding of Gun deaths and gun safety so as to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: A summary of the highlights of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.

**Question 1 + Results**: Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.

**Question 2 + Results**: Same as above.

**Question 3 + Results**: Same as above.

**Summary/Conclusion**: A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project.
