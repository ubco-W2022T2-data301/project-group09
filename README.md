## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
The issue of Gun Deaths has become a significant concern across the United States of America, and due to its impact on society, it has captured our interest. Gun Death incidents are complex and involve many different factors and underlying reasons. However, we have decided to focus on several specific aspects that we find particularly intriguing. These include the age, intent, race, date, place of incident, and education level of the victim involved in the incident.

Some variables such as education and race, may reveal interesting trends and patterns. Through our research, we aim to increase our understanding of Gun Deaths and how they disproportionately affect certain groups of people.

We hope to compile our findings and analytical results into a comprehensive dashboard at the end of our project. This dashboard will provide a user-friendly platform for others to access our research and insights on this important issue. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of Gun Deaths and to inform efforts to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset used in our study was sourced from FiveThirtyEight's Gun Deaths in America project, which was posted on data.world by Alex Zelenak. The dataset contains detailed records of around 100,000 gun-related incidents that occurred in the US between 2012 and 2014, and it includes extensive victim data for each incident. This makes it a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers who are interested in understanding the complexities of gun violence in America.
The data used to create the dataset was collected by FiveThirtyEight from various databases, including the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death Database and the FBI's list of police officers "feloniously killed" in the line of duty. The data was then carefully organized and presented in an interactive website, making it easily accessible for users to interact with and analyze.
What is important about this dataset is the depth of information it provides about the victims involved in each incident. This information includes age, race, gender, location, and educational qualifications as well. Such detailed victim data can help us better understand the demographics and circumstances surrounding gun violence in America, and potentially identify patterns and solutions.
The interactive website created from the dataset allows for easy data exploration and analysis, and it helps to increase awareness and understanding of the ongoing issue of gun violence in America. In summary, the dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in studying gun violence and its impact on society.
